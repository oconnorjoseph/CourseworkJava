/**
 * Basic Runner class for testing of the Assignment 4 application
 * 
 * The UML gives a clear overview of the components of the system, but
 * I leave out many private functions of the Tester class. The private functions
 * of the Tester class act as test cases, and these test cases cover steps 1-3 of
 * the programming part. Each test cases launches in its own window.
